# voice-enabled-chatbot
Develop a voice-enabled chatbot that transcribes speech to text (ASR), processes input through a Large Language Model (LLM) for intelligent responses, and converts those responses into speech (TTS). The system should provide seamless, real-time voice interactions with minimal delays, ensuring a smooth user experience.
